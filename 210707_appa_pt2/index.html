<span class="nbk_directive"><i>21/07/07 - Appa Eulogy Part 2</i></span>

This is a copy of a joint speech given at my father's funeral given by my sister and me. This part was read by my sister, covering my father's life from 1989 to 2021.

This next part of the story of Appa’s life over 32 years in this country is about his hard work, his will power and his discipline with the theme of community encompassing it as Computek College, SACEM, Vaanavil, and CTCC became a big part of our family’s lives.

For us though, who we grew up with was not Dr Tham, but Appa.

He was the Appa who sang loudly every morning, waking us up to spirited renditions of old Tamil movie songs. ‘Ponal pogatum poda’ and ‘Vasantha maligai’ stick out in my memory.

He was the Appa, who, before any major social event for his various community work, would march downstairs and show off his outfit of choice and check if Amma and I approved.

He was the Appa who we often witnessed absentmindedly talking to himself, sometimes even punctuating points with hand gestures. As we got older, we realized this was how he prepared for his speeches.

All of these fond and fun memories, was balanced with a very strict parenting style, and he was at times a micro manager and a perfectionist, which was sometimes difficult for us to experience, but, you have to hand it to Appa, it actually also continually pushed us to be better and Appa has had a big role to play in where we are now.

Though he pushed us, he was always there to support us when we needed it, and he didn’t just push us, he led by example - he pushed himself just as hard. Back in the 90s, he was working essentially two jobs - starting up Computek (which was basically a whole new career direction), while also working as an Engineering consultant, and also helping the community. Appa always challenged himself - relaxing for him, was not about sitting still - he was always doing something at every stage of his life.

I must mention a critical person in all of this that enabled Appa to be his best self: Amma. Amma was, is and has always been the anchor of our family. She is the one who selflessly shared Appa and took on a lot of responsibility at home so that he could help the community and so many of his family and friends.

Though we have achieved very small things compared to him, he was happy with the things we did do. Saeran is a part time lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania and Appa used to print out his research papers and read with interest. He really cared. I think he was prouder than me when I graduated from the University of Cambridge with my MBA degree. I think this was because his mentor and friend Professor Thurairajah did his PhD thesis there too. He was also very happy that he had two grandkids - he loved his frequent London to Toronto video calls.

The two lessons he continued to share with us was: it's not just about being the most educated or about making the most money. More than that, he wanted us to get two things right in our life:
Be disciplined and have will power
The second lesson was to give back. Appa helped so many extended family members and also the wider community, with time and money.

I had hoped we could share more successes with him, but it is not to be. We will all really miss him. The best way for us all in this room - his friends and family - to honor him, is to continue to find ways to make a positive impact on other people’s lives.

It’s up to us now.
