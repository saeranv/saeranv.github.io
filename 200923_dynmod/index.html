<span class="nbk_directive"><i>20/09/23 - Dynamic Modeling Thoughts</i></span>

For the past year I’ve been intermittently toying around with designing a building energy model that attempts to predict real-time thermodynamic state in response to changes in geometry and material. Typical energy modeling tools require a user to rigorously abstract a building into a simplified set of thermodynamic boundaries, properties, and processes, which are then integrated over a given time period to represent a static representation of state. Of course, with machine and statistical learning it’s possible to cut through these abstractions and model energy flows in real-time. This isn’t a novel idea, and there are numerous implementations of ML-based energy predictions floating around, but I think there are various gaps in the problem domain that could use further exploration.

I am particularly interested in the idea of experimenting with composable ML architectures that can dynamically model the spatial impact of geometry and matter. Earlier this year, I made a proof-of-concept that predicted thermal loads in simple shoe-box models with just a linear regression. I was able to get some decent results, but quickly found that it suffered when trying to account for the (nonlinear) impact of radiation. When I find some time, the next thing I need to tackle is thus predicting radiation with the use of CNNs.
