    <br>
    For the past year I’ve been intermittently toying around with designing a
    building energy model that attempts to predict real-time thermodynamic state
    in response to changes in geometry and material. Typical energy modeling tools
    require a user to rigorously abstract a building into a simplified set of
    thermodynamic boundaries, properties, and processes, which are then integrated
    over a given time period to represent a static representation of state. Of
    course, with machine and statistical learning it’s possible to cut through
    these abstractions and model energy flows in real-time. This isn’t a novel
    idea, and there are numerous implementations of ML-based energy predictions
    floating around, but I think there are various gaps in the problem domain that
    could use further exploration.
    
    I am particularly interested in the idea of experimenting with composable ML
    architectures that can dynamically model the spatial impact of geometry and
    matter. Earlier this year, I made a proof-of-concept that predicted thermal
    loads in simple shoe-box models with just a linear regression. I was able to
    get some decent results, but quickly found that it suffered when trying to
    account for the (nonlinear) impact of radiation. That was in March, and since
    then I’ve been busy moving cities, and switching jobs to properly revisit the
    problem - although I spend an inordinate amount of my day thinking about the
    issue.
    
    Luckily, it looks like I might have an excuse to revisit the problem soon. The
    purpose of this note was to revisit the problem domain and gather my
    constantly-evolving thoughts on it. The next step will be to scope out a
    simple, hackable problem that can serve as the next iteration of this idea of
    a dynamic model.
