    <br>
    For the past year I’ve been intermittently toying around with designing a
    building energy model that attempts to predict real-time thermodynamic state
    in response to changes in geometry and material. Typical energy modeling tools
    require a user to rigorously abstract a building into a simplified set of
    thermodynamic boundaries, properties, and processes, which are then solved to
    produce a static representation of state for a give time period. Of course,
    with machine and statistical learning it’s possible to cut through these
    abstractions and model energy flows in real-time. This isn’t a novel idea, and
    there are numerous implementations of ML-based energy predictions floating
    around, but I do think there are various gaps in the problem domain that need
    to be pushed further.
    
    I am particularly interested in the idea of experimenting with composable ML
    architectures that can dynamically model the spatial impact of geometry and
    matter. Earlier this year, I made a proof-of-concept that predicted thermal
    loads in simple shoe-box models with just a linear regression. I was able to
    get some decent results, but quickly found that it suffered when trying to
    account for the impact of radiation on the final heating and cooling loads.
    That was in March, and since then I’ve been busy moving cities, and switching
    jobs to properly revisit the problem - although I spend an inordinate amount
    of my day thinking about the issue.
    
    Luckily, it looks like I might have an excuse to revisit the problem soon. The
    purpose of this note was to revisit the problem domain and gather my
    constantly-evolving thoughts on it. The next step will be to scope out a
    simple, hackable problem to tackle that can serve as the next iteration of
    this dynamic model idea.
