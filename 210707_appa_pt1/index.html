This is the text of a joint speech given at my father's funeral given by my sister and me. I did the first part covering my father's career as an engineer in Sri Lanka, and my sister did the second part, covering my father's community activism in Canada.

<b>Part I: 1973 to 1989</b>

<img src="/static/images/appa_mahaweli_cropped.jpg" alt="" width="400">

This photo of Appa is taken around 1973, in Kandy when he was just starting his career with the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).

Behind him, you can see a river. That river is the Maheweli Ganga, Sri Lanka's longest river running from the inland hill country of Kandy to the low-lying coastal plains of Trincomalee harbor. In between these two locations, there are a system of cascaded system of dams that are used to generate electricity for the region.

The building of this hydroelectric infrastructure is the main part of something called the Mahaweli Development Project. This is an important project in Sri Lanka’s history: it is the country’s largest post-colonial development project and provides the bulk of electricity to the region even today.

The Mahaweli Development Project, this hugely important project begins with the construction of something called the Polgolla Barrage in 1970. You can see this barrage in the background of this photo. Appa started his career as an assistant electric engineer at this location just three years later. I visited this dam with Appa ten years ago, and he explained to me his job as an assistant electrical engineer was to maintain and test the remote-control operation of the gates of the dam, the intake apertures to underwater pressurized tunnels, and installation of the generators in the powerhouse downstream.

Appa worked with the CEB for twelve years. By the 1980s he was what was called a Divisional Development Engineer, which meant he was responsible for multiple districts. One of his jobs is to travel around as a consultant for local energy infrastructure projects, so Appa also was given a jeep and a driver by the CEB. Around the same time, he was a visiting lecturer at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Peradeniya (on the recommendation of Professor A. Thurairajah). Appa loved this jeep, and he especially loved to drive it around the Peradeniya campus, or to take it on trips with his sister, Nirmala, who was studying at Peradeniya at the time.

However, the 1980s is also the beginning of Sri Lanka’s civil war, and like other Sri Lankan Tamils, Appa experiences the protests, discrimination and riots that eventually push him to immigrate out of the country. Between the 1980s and 1985, Appa gets married, has his first daughter, and then resigns from the CEB and immigrates with his family to the U.K.

Question: What kind of job does a former Divisional Development Engineer, and part-time lecturer get in the U.K?

Back in the mid-1980s, under the xenophobic aegis of Thatcherism[1] , he ends up as a gas station attendant. This is a story Appa told me often: as a gas station attendant he was responsible for balancing an accounting log for the store. At the end of the day, he validates this log with his signature. The very same signature that until recently validated engineering documents for Sri Lanka’s largest development project. He couldn’t stand it. He felt his signature was wasted in that gas station. And so, once again in 1989, Appa resigns and immigrates with his family, this time to Canada.

Appa succeeds in Canada, in a way he couldn’t in Thatcher’s U.K in a large part due to Canada’s embrace of social and ethnic diversity encoded into its policy under the Trudeau Liberals[2]. In fact, it is Trudeau’s federal housing program that provides the funds in 1983 for a new Tamil organization, SACEM, to begin construction of social housing at Lansdown and Bloor for Tamil migrants arriving from the 83 riots. These Tamil Co-operative Homes, as they are known, will eventually serves as our family’s temporary home just after immigrating to Canada in 1989. This is the beginning of the second part of Appa’s story, when Appa begins his career as an entrepreneur and educator, that Acca will cover in more detail.

This text will only concern itself with Appa as an engineer. No matter what Appa did, he was always first and foremost a P.Eng. He never lost his mathematical acumen. He tutored me in high school calculus and used to wander into my room during university holidays and compete against me while I did my math homework. He always held onto the same pride that made him quit that gas station job: “டே! நான் ஒரு Chartered Engineer! ஒரு Divisional Engineer!" he would boast when he solved my math homework faster then I could. If I ever beat him, he liked to claim the problem itself was flawed, which he understood but I could not because, “டே! நான் ஒரு Chartered Engineer! ஒரு Divisional Engineer!"

Appa and I disagreed on a lot of things, but we always saw eye to eye on math. My love for Appa, is also why I love math.

In high school, I made a promise to myself that whatever career I ended up pursuing, it had to have enough of a math prerequisite that I could easily tutor my children in high school math, just like Appa did with me. In university, while pursuing my degree in architecture, I felt proud to use his old drafting equipment. I have them with me even now, even though no architect or engineer manually drafts plans anymore. The person who was on the phone with me every day encouraging me after I was laid off from my first job was Appa. He hung my degrees on his office wall, printed out my research papers, and when my work got too complicated for him to follow along, he took pride that I beat him. The first person who called me after I started working as a part-time lecturer was Appa, asking me about my drive to the campus, and reminding me of his days as a young engineer driving around the campus in his jeep.


<b>Part II: 1989 to 2021</b>

This next part of the story of Appa’s life over 32 years in this country is about his hard work, his will power and his discipline with the theme of community encompassing it as Computek College, SACEM, Vaanavil, and CTCC became a big part of our family’s lives.

For us though, who we grew up with was not Dr Tham, but Appa.

He was the Appa who sang loudly every morning, waking us up to spirited renditions of old Tamil movie songs. ‘Ponal pogatum poda’ and ‘Vasantha maligai’ stick out in my memory.

He was the Appa, who, before any major social event for his various community work, would march downstairs and show off his outfit of choice and check if Amma and I approved.

He was the Appa who we often witnessed absentmindedly talking to himself, sometimes even punctuating points with hand gestures. As we got older, we realized this was how he prepared for his speeches.

All of these fond and fun memories, was balanced with a very strict parenting style, and he was at times a micro manager and a perfectionist, which was sometimes difficult for us to experience, but, you have to hand it to Appa, it actually also continually pushed us to be better and Appa has had a big role to play in where we are now.

Though he pushed us, he was always there to support us when we needed it, and he didn’t just push us, he led by example - he pushed himself just as hard. Back in the 90s, he was working essentially two jobs - starting up Computek (which was basically a whole new career direction), while also working as an Engineering consultant, and also helping the community. Appa always challenged himself - relaxing for him, was not about sitting still - he was always doing something at every stage of his life.

I must mention a critical person in all of this that enabled Appa to be his best self: Amma. Amma was, is and has always been the anchor of our family. She is the one who selflessly shared Appa and took on a lot of responsibility at home so that he could help the community and so many of his family and friends.

Though we have achieved very small things compared to him, he was happy with the things we did do. Saeran is a part time lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania and Appa used to print out his research papers and read with interest. He really cared. I think he was prouder than me when I graduated from the University of Cambridge with my MBA degree. I think this was because his mentor and friend Professor Thurairajah did his PhD thesis there too. He was also very happy that he had two grandkids - he loved his frequent London to Toronto video calls.

The two lessons he continued to share with us was: it's not just about being the most educated or about making the most money. More than that, he wanted us to get two things right in our life:
Be disciplined and have will power
The second lesson was to give back. Appa helped so many extended family members and also the wider community, with time and money.

I had hoped we could share more successes with him, but it is not to be. We will all really miss him. The best way for us all in this room - his friends and family - to honor him, is to continue to find ways to make a positive impact on other people’s lives.
